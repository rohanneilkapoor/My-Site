        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>
            I worked on the team responsible for
            lending and handling small business
            loans. Because this is a relatively
            new service for American Express, my
            team was rapidly testing and monitoring
            borrower and monetary trends. To do this,
            we worked with
            managers to decide on important trends and
            design and build interactive
            data visualization applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked with 2 other engineers to create
            5 of these applications. I worked in the entire
            life cycle from discussing important trends,
            to querying relevant data, and then
            designing and building the visualizations
            and applications.

            for UI, and Splunk and it's native language
            for the data querying
            and basic visualization development (Although
            Spunk has many pre-developed
            visualization formats, they did not suite
            all of our needs, requiring further custom
            visualization development).

        <h2>
            Hackathon
        </h2>
        <p>
            <span>Prompt:</span> Solve a problem that
            either American Express customers or
            employees are facing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem my team chose to solve was
            the confusion that credit card customers
            face when attempting to navigate and make
            sense of their previous transaction history
            trends.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            Our solution was a complete re-design of the
            American Express credit card transaction
            section of the application with an emphasis
            on data visualizations. Because this was
            only a 6 hour hackathon, we weren’t able
            to perform much research other than
            confirming the need based on each other’s
            responses and a discussion of the major
            pain points. As a result, we built a number of
            features/visualizations. The three most well
            received were the following:
        </p>
        <h3>Expenses Timeline</h3>
        <p>
            <span>Problem:</span> American Express cardholders initially
            have a difficult time understanding their spending trends. It's
            difficult to see how one is currently spending compared to a previous
            time period. This makes budgeting much more challenging.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            <span>Solution:</span> We built an interactive line graph visualization showing a timeline
            of a card user’s expenses in weekly, monthly, and yearly terms.
        </p>
        <h3>Transaction Map</h3>
        <p>
            <span>Problem:</span> Credit card users sometimes have a hard
            time remembering where and when a specific
            transaction took place. Also, fraud detection isn’t perfect and is not
            always reported correctly by banks or credit card
            companies.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            <span>Solution:</span> We utilized the Google Maps API to display
            a map of a card user’s recent expenses.
            We emphasized the pins on the map that
            correlated with more recent transactions.
            The transactions that took place a while
            ago were less emphasized. This had two purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This simplifies the
                data and presents it in a way that’s easier
                to grasp.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a user is able to see that
                a transaction took place in an area he/she
                was not at during a specific time, he/she
                will more easily be able to recognize
                fraudulent use of his/her card.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>A Cleaner UI</h3>
        <p>We implemented a much simpler UI by placing
            all transactions on a physical timeline,
            making it easier for card holders to
            mentally keep track of previous transactions.
            We also emphasized transaction amounts.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top: 50px;">
            As a result we were named <span>winner</span> of the
            hackathon. Also, a visualization
            very similar to our expenses timeline
            visualization was actually launched on the
            American Express credit card application
            around the same time of our hackathon. We obviously weren't the source of this,
            but we like to joke that we were :)
