        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Slack is a team collaboration application that is mainly
            used in office settings. However, with the increased popularity
            of the product, a growing number of remote and non-traditional
            professional teams are making use of the tool. Specifically at UCLA, I have been a part of 3 separate student
            organizations and every single one has utilized Slack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am on the LA Hacks organizing team, an organization
            consisting of 35 members who meet once or twice a week but participate
            in collaborative work nearly every day. The organization consists of
            a development team, design team, marketing team, hacker experience team,
            sponsorship team, and more, much like a traditional company. As a
            result we utilize Slack on a daily basis and have found it incredibly
            helpful. Yet, members have also offered their fair share of complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
            To learn more about this, I conducted interviews with 21
            members on the LA Hacks team about their use with Slack.
            Because we are not in a traditional office setting, I found that
            67% of the LA Hacks team members use Slack significantly more on
            their mobile devices, therefore this design exercise is going to
            focus on the mobile application, specifically for iOS.</p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">I also
            performed mobile usability tests with another 10 individuals who were familiar with Slack but not the
            mobile application in an effort to delve
            further into the problems brought up in the interviews.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Problem
        </h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            Throughout my interviews, I received a broad range of feedback
            about the numerous issues people had with the mobile application.
            Some of the responses I received in interviews were people complaining
            about the absence of specific features when, in fact, they were available.
            (keep in mind, the LA Hacks team
            has been using Slack to collaborate for almost 4 months now). Others
            complained about the difficulties of making use of simple features
            claiming that “<span style="color: #616366; font-style: italic;">X</span> is hard to find” or “I always click on <span style="color: #616366; font-style: italic;">X</span>
            thinking it will do <span style="color: #616366; font-style: italic;">Y</span>.” Eventually, I began to realize that these
            “problems” being talked about were merely symptoms of a much bigger
            problem: <span>discoverability</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Solutions
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                <p>
                    Utilize Slackbot and artificial intelligence to better understand
                what the user is currently doing and assist them with useful tools.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
                    Why Slackbot? Currently, Slackbot is a powerful tool confined to a
                simple chat utility. It is meant to be an assistant to the user,
                yet it is incredibly easy to forget that it exists. Surprisingly, 100%
                    of the interviewees admitted that they rarely use it,
                    don’t know how to use it, or can't explain its specific purpose.

                Implement UI changes based off of the data collected from the usability tests.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Symptom #1: Productivity Killer</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            At times there can be too many notifications and managing those notifications
            is difficult. This results in people turning off push notifications
            and/or just ignoring slack entirely.
        </p>
        <h3>Keeping Up With Conversations</h3>
        <p><span>Problem: </span>57.1% of all interviewees said their biggest problem with Slack involved
            notification management and keeping up with conversations solely to make
            sure important information is not missed. To quote one individual, “It’s
            hard to catch up on what you missed, and to know if it’s relevant to you.
            Constantly scrolling up and reading all the messages can sometimes be a pain.”
        </p>
        <p><span>Solution #1: </span>After the user has missed an <span>important but lengthy</span>
            conversation and opens the chat screen, Slackbot pops up and offers to
            give a summary of the conversation. A conversation can be determined to
            be <span>important but lengthy</span> by an algorithm that takes into account a
            variety of factors including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The rate at which messages are being sent</li>
            <li>The types of words used</li>
            <li>The number of messages</li>
            <li>The rate of thread usage</li>
            <li>The number of people involved in the conversation</li>
        </ul>

            </video>
        </div>
        <p><span>Solution #2: </span>Slack allows you to get notified about specific words, yet
            61.9% of the interviewees did not know about this feature. Thus,
            Slackbot should give a recommendation to a user to use highlight words
            based on specific criteria. For example, a user has a
            channel on mute but has been reading the chat a considerable amount, without contributing
            much. On Slackbot’s appearance, the user can then set highlight words that
            only apply to that specific channel.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3>Muting a Channel</h3>
        <p><span>Problem: </span>42.9% of the people I interviewed didn’t know it was possible to mute a channel.
            Of those who did know about it, 58.3% of them have at least one channel on mute.
            Clearly it’s a useful feature.
        </p>
        <p><span>Solution #1: </span>Slack should utilize push notifications to let users either mute a
            channel indefinitely or mute the entire app for one hour. The reasoning for only being able
            to mute the app for one hour is that we don’t want a user to forget that the app is on mute
            and then miss important information. However, being able to indefinitely mute a channel while
            the app is unmuted means that even if the user forgets about that action, he/she can still be
            contacted through the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I added a "Reply" capability allowing the user to reply to a message without opening the app.
            I also added a "View" capability allowing the user to open the app through the notification.
        </p>

            </video>
        </div>
        <p><span>Solution #2: </span>If the user hasn’t checked a channel for a while,
            Slackbot pops up and gives the user the option to mute that specific channel.
        </p>
        <img src="images/slack_images/sub-prob1.2-sol2-wireframe.JPG" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 50px; box-shadow: 0 5px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2);">

        </div>
        <h3>Threading</h3>
        <p><span>Problem: </span>Many of the individuals who claimed their biggest problem to be notification
            management said that one reason for this is that there are too many one-on-one conversations. Funnily
            enough, while conducting these interviews, Slack actually released its new <a class="mrkt-link" href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14305528/slack-threads-threaded-messages" target="_blank">threading feature</a>. Yet as
            of writing this, it has been one week and <span>not a single person</span> on the LA Hacks team has utilized a
            thread.
        </p>
        <p><span>Solution: </span>If a select few people are having a <span>one-on-one extended</span> conversation,
            Slackbot offers a suggestion to start a thread. A conversation can be determined to be <span>one-on-one</span>
            and <span>extended</span> by an algorithm that takes into account a variety of factors such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of people present in the conversation</li>
            <li>A spike in the number of individuals that utilized my previous feature of muting the channel from push notifications</li>
            <li>The kind of words being used in the conversation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptom #2: Layout Issues</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            The layout of the mobile application is
            incredibly well-designed. However throughout my interviews,
            I noticed two concerns that prompted me to conduct usability tests. For these usability
            tests, I worked with 10 individuals who are familiar with Slack but not its mobile
            application. Thus, they understood the key features of the app and its purpose but didn't
            know much about the layout of the mobile application.
        </p>
        <h3>Chat Information Architecture</h3>
        <p><span>Problem: </span>In my interviews, 3 people specifically brought up their frustration with finding
            pinned posts. Interested in this, I asked the individuals in my usability tests to find pinned posts
            in a specific channel. 50% of them initially scrolled up in the chat. Another 20% clicked
            the three dot icon on the top right of the navigation bar. This indicates that most users assumed it
            to be somewhere at the top of their screen but it’s not very clear how everything is organized.
        </p>
        <p><span>Solution: </span>Alter the top navigation bar. Get rid of the search button and place it
            in a separate modal since it doesn't have to do with navigating the app and is a different form of
            navigation when compared to the other 3.
            Move the title of the channel to the middle to convey the idea that all
            options for the channel can be found there. The slack logo on the top left is for moving
            to the left to the channel/message directories and the 3 vertical dots is for navigating
            to the right to see personal settings and options. Implement a modal that doesn’t navigate
            the user away from the chat screen to make the process feel quicker. Only place the most
            used features in there and place a button that will allow the user to get to more options
            that are essentially used less.
        </p>
        <img src="images/slack_images/sub-prob2.2-sol1-wireframe.JPG" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 50px; box-shadow: 0 5px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2);">
        <img src="images/slack_images/before-after-nav.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 100px; margin-top: 50px;">
        <img src="images/slack_images/sub-prob2.2-sol1-mockups.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 50px;">

        <div class="iphone-container" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 50px;">
            <video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">
                <source src="images/slack_prototypes/sub-prob-2.2-finished.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>
        </div>
        <h3>Icon Inconsistency</h3>
        <p><span>Problem: </span>When interviewing one individual, we discovered that on mobile
            the "+" icon next to "Channels" in the channel directory is for showing all existing channels. However on desktop,
            that same button is for creating a new channel, while clicking “Channels” shows all
            existing channels. The interviewee said that this was incredibly confusing.
        </p>
        <p>Because a user is more likely to search for existing channels on his/her mobile app,
            I asked each user in my test to do just that.
            Interestingly, every single one of them clicked “All Threads”. 80% of them also told me
            that they thought the "+" icon was for “creating a new channel” since the "+" is usually
            utilized to convey "new" or "add" in most apps.
        </p>
        <p><span>Solution: </span>Leave the desktop alone since it utilizes the icon correctly. On mobile,
            get rid of the "+" and change to “View All”. Change “All Threads” to “Active Threads”, since the
            use of “All” can be connected to the idea of “All Channels”.
        </p>
