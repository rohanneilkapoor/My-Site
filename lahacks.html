        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Hacker Experience</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">Hacker experience is the entirety of the participant’s
            experience from the moment he/she walks in the door
            to the moment he/she leaves. <span>This is the foundation
            for how we measure our success.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Laying a Foundation</h3>
        <p>
            Before doing any branding, I wanted to lay a foundation
            structured around the purpose of LA Hacks and what we
            hope to achieve this year. Because hacker experience is the direct
            measurement of success, I started with studying all of
            the "end-of-hackathon" surveys we have hackers fill out.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also spoke with numerous hackers, both during and after
            last year’s event, about how they view LA Hacks, what they
            liked about our event, what they don’t like, etc. I made an
            effort to receive opinions from both young/new hackers as
            well as experienced hackers. I also sifted through previous
            sponsor reviews. Although the hackathon is about the hackers,
            there is no hackathon without our sponsors, thus their happiness
            is just as important. The two most common forms of critical feedback were:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            <li>There were a lot of people at the event who weren’t hacking</li>
            <li>The hacks from last year weren’t that impressive</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/lahacks_surveys.jpg" class="med-image" style="box-shadow: 0 5px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2); margin-bottom: 45px;">
        <img src="images/lahacks_surveys2.jpg" class="med-image" style="box-shadow: 0 5px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2);">
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 45px">Source: LA Hacks, Hackathon Event 2016 Google Sheet</h5>
        <p>
            From there I conducted interviews with previous organizers
            and current organizers. The goal of each interview was to better
            understand what each organizer wants LA Hacks to be. The most
            common answer was something along the lines of the following:
        </p>
        <p >
            <span>Goal:</span> To provide an environment where hackers from all backgrounds
            and experience levels can come together to learn from one another
            and inevitably build something both <span>useful</span> and <span>meaningful</span> to the
            best of their abilities.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            Clearly there was a major disconnect between what the organizers wanted and what the hackers saw.
        </p>

        <h2>Logistical Solutions</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">Because I was a Director of Operations last year, I thought a
            lot about how we could solve these problems from an operations
            perspective with the entire team. We came up with the following solutions:
        </p>
        <h3>Setting the Date</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">We noticed that most of the
            people who came to LA Hacks for non-hacking reasons were students
            from the UC system. Thus, we decided to host the hackathon, the
            weekend at the end of spring break right before spring quarter
            starts. This way, we hoped that only the people who genuinely
            wanted to hack would come.</p>
        <h3>Data Hacks</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">We introduced a track for data hackers
            that would be judged separately from all other hacks. This is
            a rapidly growing field and we felt that if we provided a
            specific platform for those interested in a specific field, it
            would cause excitement among those in that community.</p>
        <h3>Installations</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">At the start of the hackathon, there
            is a lot of down time before the hacking begins. Because hacker
            experience is defined as the entirety of the participant’s
            experience as soon as he/she walks in the doors, we needed
            to make better use of this time. We decided to have design/tech-related
            installations for the participants to interact with both for
            entertainment and inspiration. </p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            From there, I thought about how to address the problems
            introduced above with our brand. How could we represent
            ourselves to show that we are welcoming, yet serious about
            putting on a hackathon where all participants are hacking
            and building something useful and meaningful.
        </p>
        <h3>Branding Research</h3>
        <p>
            Like I said earlier, I met all different kinds of
            people and talked to them about how they currently
            viewed LA Hacks and where they want it to go. For
            brand purposes, I spoke with the organizers about
            how they wanted the LA Hacks brand to be perceived.
            A lot was said and I narrowed it down to the following 4
            themes that would encompass the entirety of the brand:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            <li>community-based</li>
            <li>approachable</li>
            <li>professional</li>
            <li>empowering</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            Notice how there’s <span>no mention of technology</span>.
            That’s because LA Hacks isn’t about the latest advancements
            in VR or data science. It’s about coming together as a
            community to learn from others and solve problems by building
            something meaningful and useful. Technology is simply the means in which
            it's accomplished.
        </p>

        </h5>
        <p>
            Finally, all of this led me to the <span>building block</span>. I wanted to evoke that sense
            of “actually building something” in our brand. <span>Essentially at LA Hacks, we come together as a community to build.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            My process began with creating simple types of blocks as inspiration.
        </p>
        <img src="images/lahacks_logo_iterations.png" style="margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

            Eventually, I ended with an event logo. I wanted to convey the idea of "coming together to build."
