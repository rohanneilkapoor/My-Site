        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Last quarter I took a computer science class titled
            “Scalable Internet Services”. The purpose of the
            class was to teach students how to build a scalable
            full stack web application using Ruby on Rails. Although,
            this was a class focused on purely technical details and
            results, I approached part of the project a little differently.
            Essentially, I thought about how I can...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design the overall web application</li>
                <li>Design the user interface for <span>scalability</span></li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            At the end of every school year, college students are
            moving out of their apartments and looking to get rid
            of their unwanted stuff. While some resort to selling
            their items on a Facebook page, many students want to
            simply get rid of everything as quickly as possible
            without a concern for making money.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">Mrkt is an online marketplace where college students can
            post their unwanted belongings to be claimed for free.
            Others can browse public posts, claim an item, and then
            get in contact with the poster to come pickup the item.
            Once an item is claimed, the post is removed from the
            feed of all other users.
        </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Confirming The Need</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            I started by studying UCLA’s free and for sale page at the beginning of
            the quarter (this is the height of when most people are selling/giving
            away their stuff since leases are ending). I saw that about 1 in 5 posts were offering something for
            free or at an absurdly low price.
        </p>
        <img class="aza" src="images/mrkt_facebook1.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 60%; box-shadow: 0 5px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2); margin-top:50px !important; margin-bottom: 50px;">

        <img class="aza" src="images/mrkt_facebook2.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 60%; box-shadow: 0 5px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2); margin-top:50px !important; margin-bottom: 50px;">

        <p>
            I also claimed some of the free stuff and
            bought some of the absurdly cheap items to get a better feel for the process.
            For the items that I bought, I found that many of the people selling at low
            prices <span>never ended up charging me for the items</span> and others <span>charged me even
            less than what was advertised</span> because they were simply looking to get rid
            of their stuff as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            I also informally surveyed 22 friends. I found that 17 of them,
            at some point in college, have given away something from their apartment
            for free. The most popular reason was simply that they were in a
            hurry and just needed to get rid of their stuff. Furthermore, I
            found that about half of these giveaways were given to friends,
            yet when asked about whether or not they would be willing to give
            away that item to a stranger, nearly all of them said yes.
        </p>
        <img src="images/mrkt_chart.svg" width="100%" >
        <h3>Issues With Facebook</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            The main issue with Free and For sale pages on Facebook is that
            it requires a lot of management on the poster’s side. Poster’s
            are constantly getting messages and notifications about the
            post and he/she also has to update the post to say whether or
            not his/her item has been sold/claimed. This is problematic.
            People posting items for free on Free and For Sale are doing
            so because they are in a rush and/or are stressed. They
            shouldn’t have to constantly be checking Facebook to get
            something so simple done.

        <h2>Application Layout</h2>
        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">In my interviews I found that most
            people looking to get rid of stuff for free were in a
            hurry because their lease was ending and/or they needed to move
            out ASAP. I took this into account when designing the onboarding
            process. I wanted to keep it quick. I also took into account
            people who were simply checking out the site. Thus, I decided
            to show live posts by people near the user to pique their interest.

        <h3>Shopping Cart</h3>
        <p>If an item is not picked up during the time range determined
            by the poster, the item is removed from the “claimers” shopping
            cart and put back in public view. If a “claimer” does this past
            a certain number of times, the claimer is temporarily banned from the website.

        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>The profile is simply a central page to display a user’s basic
            information as well as all posts he/she has made. Each post
            also displays it’s current status (claimed/unclaimed).

        <p style="padding-bottom: 0 !important; padding-top: 30px;">The image
            would be the main focus, and the name and distance from the poster's location
            would be overlayed on the image. I chose to place the
            distance over the image by the name to draw attention. A user
            can hover over the post for a description.
        </p>
        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>Because a user is free to upload any picture, the application can run into the following problem.</p>
        <img src="images/mrkt_bad_pic.jpg" class="small-image">
        <p style="padding-top: 30px;">Thus, I needed to figure out a way to place text on
            any image while keeping it both legible and visually
            pleasing. There’s a number of approaches…</p>

        <h3>Scalability (cont.)</h3>
        <p>
            Another issue with posts can be seen with image file sizes. What if a user were to
            upload a really large file? Because the application was being developed
            for scale, I had to take this into account. Having multiple posts in a feed with
            large image file sizes could significantly slow down the load/rendering times of
            the pages. Therefore, I utilized <a class="mrkt-link" href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to compress each image when uploaded
            so that no image would exceed a height of 750 pixels while maintaining its dimensional
            ratio. Having a maximum height for each image also allowed for a more visually
            appealing feed and an overall better user experience.

    <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6">

<div class="body" style="padding-bottom: 0; padding-top: 0;">
    <section>
        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>I liked some aspects of #2. It was structured and geometrical making it
            easy to scan for items. But there was a lot of wasted space.
            It wasn’t the most ideal for feeds that would have lots of posts.
            <span>It wouldn’t scale well.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, I decided on #3. The idea was that
            once a user publishes a post, it will show up on everyone else’s
            feed in the most optimal location to minimize the total height of
            everyone’s feed while maintaining a consistent feed width. While it
            was also a visually pleasing UI, I mainly picked it for UX reasons:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            <li>The user had to scroll the least to see the highest number of posts on their screen</li>
            <li>The feed saved space, maintaining ideal rendering/load times</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            To implement this grid-based feed, I utilized
            <a class="mrkt-link" href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a>. Masonry
            is a JavaScript library that maintains a consistent grid width
            while keeping the vertical height as small as possible. When a post is added,
            Masonry positions the element to the grid in the most optimal
            location such that the width is maintained and the vertical height
            stays as small as possible.
        </p>
        </section>
</div>
        <img src="images/mrkt_feed.jpg" style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right:5%; margin: 0 auto;  max-width: 1300px;">
<div class="body" style="padding-top: 70px !important; padding-bottom: 0;">
    <section>
        <p>Another issue that comes up when scaling has to do with the number
            of posts in a feed. The more posts there are, the longer it will
            take for the page to load. Therefore, I segmented the posts using
            pagination (I utilized the ruby gem
            <a class="mrkt-link" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/will_paginate/versions/3.1.5">will_paginate</a>). This way, a
            feed is broken up into X number of pages with each page  holding
            a specific number of posts.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;"> This allows for an ideal load time and
            will still show plenty of posts on one page. From a user experience
            perspective, this is great for load times, yet I don’t think it’s ideal.
            If I were to go back and re-do the project, I would’ve made use of
            <a class="mrkt-link" href="https://github.com/jassa/lazyload-rails">lazy
            loading</a>. I feel this is ideal for user experience because the user doesn’t
            have to click for the next page. Instead the feed will load more posts once
            the user is at the bottom of the page.
