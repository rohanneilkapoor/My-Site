        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Sigma Eta Pi was founded at UCLA in 2010. It is the west
            coast’s first entrepreneurship fraternity and has grown
            to see chapters at numerous universities such as Stanford,
            UC Berkeley, USC, and more. Because the organization is still
            so new, we are always exploring creative and innovative ways to grow.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            Every fall and spring quarter at UCLA, Sigma Eta Pi hosts
            rush events to recruit its newest members. In fall 2016,
            I designed promotional materials and worked on social media
            strategy to host <span>the largest rush event the fraternity has ever seen</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Achievements
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nearly 100 unique members at rush, a <span>28% increase</span> from the previous quarter</li>
            <li>Facebook posts reached a total of over 12,000 people, nearly half of which were organic, <span>in less than 2 weeks</span></li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p><span>Maximize the number of attendees at rush.</span></p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0 !important;">Because the fraternity is so new and constantly changing,
            there is no defined standard for new members. There is
            no minimum GPA requirement, you don’t have to own a startup,
            and your major does not matter. We simply wanted to
            meet as many people as possible.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0 !important;">
            For previous recruitment events, we took advantage of a few
            different marketing tactics ranging from Facebook
            ads to snapchat filters to T-shirts. During each
            rush event, we had attendees fill out surveys to tell
            us how they heard about us, and with every set of
            surveys there was always one medium that beat the rest: <span>flyers</span>.
        </p>

        </h5>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0 !important;">
            I also spent a lot of time at previous recruitment
            events talking with attendees about what they were
            looking for in the fraternity. Interestingly, most
            of the people we eventually accepted tended to be
            looking for a group that placed a strong, yet equal emphasis on
            professional goals as well as a social environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the above results, it made the most sense for me to focus on flyers, maximizing referrals from friends, and Facebook strategy.
        </p>
        <p>When thinking about how I wanted to design our promotional materials,
            I decided that the design of our brand elements would <span>not</span> be uniform
            across mediums. Essentially, I didn’t want to put the fraternity in
            a category because it was so new compared to all the other fraternities
            on campus. When people saw our content, I wanted the experience to feel
            unexpected, unique, and, most importantly, <span>memorable</span>.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0 !important;">I decided to start with the flyer. From there, I thought about the
            experience of someone being handed the flyer by a member. What
            was the first impression of the member, and <span>how can that be affected
            by the flyer and other materials?</span> I then, finally moved on to Facebook strategy. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Flyers</h2>
        <p>
            Because we were competing with hundreds of student organizations
            handing out flyers on campus every day, I wanted to come up with
            a flyer that would stand out. I wanted the flyers to meet the following criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>People could see and actually notice them from great distances</li>
            <li>People would show them to their friends</li>
            <li>The flyers would only display the most important information to maintain slight ambiguity to further pique interest</li>
            <li>The flyers would actually get the reader to go to our website/Facebook page</li>
        </ul>



        <div class="row" style="padding-top: 50px;">
            <h5 class="col-xs-4" style="text-align: center">#F3F315</h5>
            <h5 class="col-xs-4" style="text-align: center">#15A9F3</h5>
            <h5 class="col-xs-4" style="text-align: center">#4A4A4A</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="row" style="">
            <div class="palette col-xs-4" style="background-color: #F3F315;"></div>
            <div class="palette col-xs-4" style="background-color: #15A9F3;"></div>
            <div class="palette col-xs-4" style="background-color: #4A4A4A;"></div>

    <section>
        <h2>T-Shirts</h2>
        <p>
            I thought about how our organization should be perceived when
            being handed the above flyer by a member wearing our T-shirt.
            I wanted that experience to leave an impression on the person
            being handed the flyer that would ultimately pique his/her
            interest and decide to seek out more information.
        </p>
        <p>Essentially, I decided to emphasize the social aspect of
            the fraternity with a Los Angeles-based vibe. The
            combination of this T-shirt and our flyer could set a
            bold yet relaxed tone emphasizing the fraternity’s “work hard, play hard”
            mentality. Thus the T-shirts would meet the following criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasize a relaxed/LA-based vibe to reflect the social aspects of the organization</li>
            <li>People could see and actually notice them from great distances </li>
            <li>Both the male and female members would be excited to wear them</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Facebook Strategy</h2>
        <p>In an effort to differentiate ourselves from all other
            professional fraternities on Facebook, I decided to
            focus on the content of our posts, rather than designing
            graphics for social media. I wanted these posts to feel
            genuine. My approach was to strategically make social
            media posts about current members/recent alumni and what
            they’ve accomplished in terms of entrepreneurship. </p>
        <img class="aza" src="images/aza_steel.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 60%; box-shadow: 0 5px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2); margin-top:50px !important; margin-bottom: 50px;">
        <p>
            I started with posts about younger members first, and as the
            event grew closer, I shifted towards alumni who had the most
            impressive accomplishments. I sent out the above post the night
            before our first rush event and the results were better than expected.
            Within two days, the post had reached nearly <span>3,500 people</span>. In
            the end, the final collection of posts reached a total of over <span>12,000 people,
            nearly half of which were organic</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final result was a recruitment event hosting nearly 100 attendees, a 28%
            increase from the previous quarter, and <span>the largest rush event the fraternity
            had ever seen</span>.
        </p>
