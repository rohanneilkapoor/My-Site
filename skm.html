        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            SKM Industries Inc. is a CNC machining company based
            in Valencia, CA. The company does contractual manufacturing
            for organizations in a wide variety of industries including as
            aerospace, medical, and commercial. Last summer SKM Industries
            approached me to design and build a responsive and mobile
            friendly company website that would differentiate itself from
            its competition.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            After the site launch, SKM Industries was also able to secure work
            with a number of new clients including <span>Mitsubishi</span>,
            <span>Hyperloop One</span>, and <span>University of California,
            Irvine</span>. The site saw a number of new order requests
            including one on the same day of the launch.
            SKM Industries also saw an influx in job applicants.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The CNC machining industry is incredibly competitive, especially
            in the Los Angeles area. Most company websites in the industry
            show very few differentiating services and features, and each
            site itself feels incredibly outdated. SKM Industries’ website
            was no exception. Also, during this time, SKM Industries was
            struggling to find work because:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Its main client, a company that provided SKM Industries with
                over half of its work, was struggling financially
            </li>
            <li>
                The machining industry was affected because of an economic downturn
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            <span>Differentiate</span> SKM Industries from its competitors so
            that it can secure a <span>diverse</span> set of clients.
        </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Confirming the Need</h3>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, because it’s current website was so outdated,
            there were no analytics or other tools set up to tell me about
            their traffic. Thus, I conducted interviews with the client
            and other similar machine shops. I reached out to both machine
            shops with outdated and non-outdated websites. We discussed what
            companies look for in a machine shop when looking to get
            contracting work done. Because these companies also hire
            other machine shops to do some contracting work, they provided
            answers as both the buyer and the seller. Furthermore, we discussed
            what one looks for on a machine shop’s website.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            I found that buyers almost always visit the machine shop’s
            websites looking for a <span>Portfolio</span>
            and <span>Capabilities</span> section. Also, as with many other
            industries, buyers look for reputation. If a company has
            done impressive work with well-known
            companies, they’re more likely to secure more clients.
        </p>
        <h3>Client Research</h3>
        <p>
            In order to differentiate SKM from it’s competition,
            I interviewed the client numerous times looking for
            differentiating features. Since the Portfolio and
            Capabilities sections were the most important, I searched
            for more information about the company that would help me
            make these sections more unique when compared to competitors.
            The following were mutually agreed to be the most important
            differentiating features to display on the website:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Most shops use paper to send information within the shop.
                The client built its own custom software that uses machine mounted
                iPads to send information.
            </li>
            <li>
                The client does production, short run, and assembly work. Very few
                of its competitors do all three categories of work.
            </li>
            <li>
                The client's facility runs off of 70% solar energy due
                to rooftop-mounted solar panels.
            </li>
            <li>
                The client has done work for big companies/organizations
                such as Lockheed Martin, Caltech, and Haas.
            </li>
            <li>
                Throughout its existence, the client has done work
                for companies in 7 different industries.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Website Goal</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            Convince the visitor to request a quote/get in contact
            with the client by either filling out a form or
            directly contacting the shop themselves.
        </p>

        <h2>Website Overview</h2>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Desktop Landing Page</h3>
        <img src="images/skm_wireframe.png" style="width: 100%">
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Desktop Capabilities Modal</h3>
        <img src="images/skm_wireframe_cap.png" style="width: 100%">

        <img src="images/skm_mobile_wireframe.png" style="width: 100%">
        <h3>UX</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            I wanted the site to be incredibly simple in terms
            on navigation. The idea was that the user lands on
            the page and only needs to scroll down and click to see
            everything. Because the capabilities and portfolio
            section required a bit more information, I put them
            into <span>modals</span> instead of separate pages. That way a
            user can scroll down the main page, click a button
            to get to the capabilities modal, and then exit the
            modal to find himself/herself back at the same place
            on the main page. <span>No page refresh or extra scrolling.</span>
            The experience should be one smooth flow.
        </p>
        <h3>UI</h3>
        <p>Because of branding and logo constraints, I couldn't alter the main red.
        So I grouped it with other calmer colors to give the palette a more modern feel.</p>
